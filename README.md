## Description

- Three pages, accessibles with tabs, present a restaurant location and menus
- Only the main content is changed, the header and footer still the same
- The neon style gives a scifi (cyberpunk) city vibe

## Challenges
The goal was to cleanly separate the JavaScript code using ES6 modules, which requires to use Webpack for using *import* and *export* statements.

CSS is a bit deepens in this project, to practice more (among other things) the organisation of classes, lighting effects with shadows, titles decorations and *:before* and *:after* added elements.
